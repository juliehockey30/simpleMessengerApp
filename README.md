This project is a simple instant messenger app.

## Getting Started

Once you have cloned the project and naviagted to its directory, run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

To "chat" with yourself or another person, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in multiple different browser windows while the app is running locally.

Note that because this is relatively hacked together, all messages sent are final, and cannot be deleted.
Additionally, everyone with access to this app can see the messages.

## Technologies Used:

React, Firebase, Styled Components

## App Limitations/Rooms for improvement:

First and foremost, I would like to give the the user the ability to clear the messages once they are done testing/playing with the app.

Additionally, for future work, it would be nice to be able to have multiple different conversations with different people, more similar to the way modern instant chat apps work in production.
